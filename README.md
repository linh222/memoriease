# MemoriEase

**MemoriEase** is an advanced lifelog retrieval system that helps users search, explore, and analyze lifelog data, including images, text, and metadata. Evolving through several years of research and competition at the Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC), MemoriEase integrates powerful retrieval techniques, a conversational interface, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for question answering.
